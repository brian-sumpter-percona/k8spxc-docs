# *Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster* 1.12.0

* **Date**

    November 30, 2022

* **Installation**

    [Installing Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](index.md#quickstart-guides)

## Release Highlights

* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks.md) is now officially supported platform, so developers and vendors of the solutions based on the Azure platform can take advantage of the official support from Percona or just use officially certified Percona Operator for MongoDB images

## New Features

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1043) }} Support for the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks.md)
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1005) }} Add support of Microsoft Azure Blob storage for the backups
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1010) }} template innodb_buffer_pool_size with instance memory size
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1082) }} Ability to ignore specific annotations for k8s Service objects
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1120) }} Add headless service support for restore pod
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1140) }} Allow replication channels over SSL (thanks to Alvaro Aguilar-Tablada Espinosa for contribution)

## Improvements

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(955) }} Provide static IP-address for LoadBalancer
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1032) }} Disable [automated upgrade](../update.md#operator-update-smartupdates) by default to prevent an unplanned downtime for user applications and to provide defaults more focused on strict userâ€™s control over the cluster
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1095) }} process the sigterm signal
* {{ k8spxcjira(1104) }} Starting from now, the Opearator changed its API version to v1 instead of having a separate API version for each release. Three last API version are supported in addition to `v1`, which substantially reduces the size of Custom Resource Definition to prevent reaching the etcd limit
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1113) }} Utilize dual password MySQL feature to change passwords
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1125) }} Operator should not try to start PMM if there is no 'pmmserverkey or pmmserver' key in secret
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1153) }} Improve logging
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1039) }} get primary pxc pod: failed to get proxySQL db
