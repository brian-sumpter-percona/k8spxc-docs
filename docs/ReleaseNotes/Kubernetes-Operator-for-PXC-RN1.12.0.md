# *Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster* 1.12.0

* **Date**

   November 30, 2022

* **Installation**

   [Installing Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](index.md#quickstart-guides)

## Release Highlights

* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks.md) is now officially supported platform, so developers and vendors of the solutions based on the Azure platform can take advantage of the official support from Percona or just use officially certified Percona Operator for MongoDB images

## New Features

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1043) }}: Support for the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks.md)
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1005) }}: Add support of Microsoft Azure Blob storage for the backups
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1010) }}: template innodb_buffer_pool_size with instance memory size
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1082) }}: Ability to ignore specific annotations for k8s Service objects
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1120) }}: Add headless service support for restore pod
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1140) }}: Allow replication channels over SSL (thanks to Alvaro Aguilar-Tablada Espinosa for contribution)

## Improvements

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(955) }}: Provide static IP-address for LoadBalancer
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1032) }}: Disable [automated upgrade](../update.md#operator-update-smartupdates) by default to prevent an unplanned downtime for user applications and to provide defaults more focused on strict userâ€™s control over the cluster
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1095) }}: process the sigterm signal
* {{ k8spxcjira(1104) }}: Starting from now, the Opearator changed its API version to v1 instead of having a separate API version for each release. Three last API version are supported in addition to `v1`, which substantially reduces the size of Custom Resource Definition to prevent reaching the etcd limit
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1113) }}: Utilize dual password MySQL feature to change passwords
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1125) }}: Operator should not try to start PMM if there is no 'pmmserverkey or pmmserver' key in secret
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1153) }}: Improve logging
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1039) }}: get primary pxc pod: failed to get proxySQL db

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1065) }}: Make bucket destination more unique
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1096) }}: Possible data loss with default helm chart settings for pxc operator **Open**
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1110) }}: backup fails but is marked as finished **Open**
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1123) }}: PXC operator can not find own Pod (thanks to Bart Vercoulen for reporting this issue)
* 
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(924) }}: Operator goes in CrashLoopBackOff when the node running the pod crashes
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1028) }}: auto tuning for innodb_buffer_pool variables is not ok
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1029) }} and {{ k8spsmdbjira(835) }}: Fix a bug that prevented ProxySQL to be used in replica cluster at [cross-site replication](replication.md) **Open**
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1030) }}: Fix the bug of cert-manager certificate being not deleted with the cluster deletion, which caused it being not renewed by cert-manager for a deleted-and-recreated cluster; the new [delete-ssl](operator.md#finalizers-delete-ssl) finalizer was introduced to address the issue
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1036) }}: Liveness check fails when XtraBackup is running and wsrep_sync_wait is set
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1042) }}: Avoid 'syntax error' in backup.sh in case of not getting cluster size
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1059) }}: pxc-monit and proxysql-monit containers print passwords
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1099) }}: Fix CrashLoopBackOff error caused by incorrect (non-atomic) multi-user password change
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1100) }}: Fix a bug that made it impossible to use slash characters in the monitor user's password **In progress**
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1118) }}: PITR collector gaps hard to monitor
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1122) }}: Fix a bug that caused S3 backups fail with error about unsuccessful binlogs certificate verification (thanks to Draken for reporting this issue)
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1137) }}: Fix a bug that prevented adding, deleting or updating ProxySQL Service labels/annotations except at the Service creation time
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1138) }}: Fix a bug due to which not enough responsive scripts for readiness and liveness Probes could be the reason of killing the overloaded database Pods
* {{ k8spsmdbjira(997) }}: **PRIVATE** PXC 5.7 backups missing (at least) one failure condition
