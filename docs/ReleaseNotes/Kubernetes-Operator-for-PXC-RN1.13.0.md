## Release Highlights

## New Features

* {{ k8spxcjira(1224) }}: New `backup.allowParallel` Custom Resource option allows to disable running backup jobs in parallel, which can be useful to avoid connection issues caused by the cluster overload

## Improvements

* {{ k8spxcjira(362) }}: Code clean-up and refactoring for checking if ProxySQL and HAProxy enabled in the Custom Resource (thanks to Vladislav Safronov for contributing)
* {{ k8spxcjira(1088) }}: It is now possilbe to configure CPU and memory resources for the backup restore job in the `PerconaXtraDBClusterRestore` Custom Resource options
* {{ k8spxcjira(1166) }}: Starting from now, Docker image tags for Percona XtraBackup contain include full XtraBackup version instead of the major number used before
* {{ k8spxcjira(1189) }}: Improve security and meet compliance requirements by building the Operator based on Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) 9 instead of UBI 8
* {{ k8spxcjira(1192) }}: Backup and restore documentation was substantially improved to make it easier to work with, and [backup restore options](../operator.md#perconaxtradbclusterrestore-custom-resource-options) have been added to the Ð¡ustom Resource reference
* {{ k8spxcjira(1210) }}: HAProxy service [can now be configured](...) as [headless](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) at service creation time
* {{ k8spxcjira(1225) }}: The Operator (system) users are now created with the `PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER` policy to avoid breaking the cluster due to the password expiration set by the `default_password_lifetime` system variable

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spxcjira(1179) }}: Fix the bug due to which the Operator couldn't use TLS encryption for system users
* {{ k8spxcjira(1188) }}: The database Helm chart has improved defaults, including the use of random passwords generated by the Operator, and disabling `delete-pxc-pvc` and `delete-proxysql-pvc` finalizers to avoid possible data loss during migration
* {{ k8spxcjira(1220) }}: DNS resolution problem forces haproxy to remove all pxc nodes, including alive ones
* {{ k8spxcjira(1164) }}: Fix a bug which caused the Operator to recreate Secrets in case of the ProxySQL to  HAProxy switch with active `delete-proxysql-pvc` finalizer
* {{ k8spxcjira(1255) }}: The log rotation was broken for the audit log, causing it to be written to the old file after the rotation
* {{ k8spxcjira(687) }}: restore not starting after failed restore on another cluster
* {{ k8spxcjira(835) }} and {{ k8spxcjira(1029) }}: Fix the bug which prevented using ProxySQL on the replica cluster in cross-site replication
* {{ k8spxcjira(989) }}: Fix a bug which caused on-demand (manual) backup to fail in IPv6-enabled (dual-stack) environments because fo the backup script unable to figure out the proper Pod IPv4 address (thanks to Song Yang for contribution)
* {{ k8spxcjira(1106) }}: Fix a bug which caused point-in-time recovery failure in case of a corrupted binlog file existence in `/var/lib/mysql`
* {{ k8spxcjira(1122) }}: The new `verifyTLS` PerconaXtraDBClusterRestore Custom Resource option allows to disable verification of the storage server TLS certificate, which may be useful e.g. to skip TLS verification for private S3-compatible storage with a self-issued certificate **IMPROVEMENT** 
* {{ k8spxcjira(1129) }}: Operator doesn't scale PXC pods to original size after PITR restore **NOT REPRODUCIBLE** 
* {{ k8spxcjira(1135) }}: Fix a bug which made it possible for cluster to incorrectly obtain READY status while  the svc EXTERNAL-IP was still in pending state
* {{ k8spxcjira(1149) }}: Pvc finalizer doesn't delete secrets if we use default secret name
* {{ k8spxcjira(1161) }}: pmm stops monitoring haproxy pods after pmmserverkey change
* {{ k8spxcjira(1163) }}: Can't delete cluster in init state if using finalizers
* {{ k8spxcjira(1183) }}: Fresh installation uses mysql_native_password instead of caching_sha2_password
* {{ k8spxcjira(1193) }}: Operator requests cert-manager to generate server certificates with `IsCA: True` set
* {{ k8spxcjira(1197) }}: Backup Finalizer do not correctly delete backups from Azure
* {{ k8spxcjira(1199) }}: Operator can't restore the azure backup if 'spec.backupSource.azure.container' was not specified 
* {{ k8spxcjira(1205) }}: Operator cannot delete backups on s3 with custom TLS
* {{ k8spxcjira(1206) }}: pxc.livenessProbes.timeoutSeconds documentation differs from kubernetes.io
* {{ k8spxcjira(1229) }}: Fix backup deletion from azure
* {{ k8spxcjira(1236) }}: Fix the pxc container entypoint script printing passwords into the standart output
* {{ k8spxcjira(1242) }}: Fix the bug due to which the unquoted password value was passed to the pmm-admin commands, making PMM Client unable to add MySQL service
* {{ k8spxcjira(1243) }}: Fix the bug which prevented deleting PMM agent from the PMM Server inventory on Pod termination
* {{ k8spxcjira(1126) }}: Fix the bug that `pxc-db`Helm chart had PVC-based backup storage enabled by default, which could be inconvenient for the users storign backups in cloud

## Supported Platforms

The Operator was developed and tested with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.32 and 5.7.42. Other options may also work but have not been tested.

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
1.13.0:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.21 - 1.24

* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.21 - 1.24

* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) 1.22 - 1.24

* [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.10 - 4.11

* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) 1.28

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
