## Release Highlights

## New Features and improvements

* {{ k8spxcjira(1224) }}: New `backup.allowParallel` Custom Resource option allows to disable running backup jobs in parallel, which can be useful to avoid connection issues caused by the cluster overload

* {{ k8spxcjira(362) }}: Code clean-up and refactoring for checking if ProxySQL and HAProxy enabled in the Custom Resource (thanks to Vladislav Safronov for contributing)
* {{ k8spxcjira(1088) }}: It is now possilbe to configure CPU and memory resources for the backup restore job in the `PerconaXtraDBClusterRestore` Custom Resource options
* {{ k8spxcjira(1166) }}: Starting from now, Docker image tags for Percona XtraBackup contain include full XtraBackup version instead of the major number used before
* {{ k8spxcjira(1189) }}: Improve security and meet compliance requirements by building the Operator based on Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) 9 instead of UBI 8
* {{ k8spxcjira(1192) }}: Backup and restore documentation was substantially improved to make it easier to work with, and [backup restore options](../operator.md#perconaxtradbclusterrestore-custom-resource-options) have been added to the Ð¡ustom Resource reference
* {{ k8spxcjira(1210) }}: HAProxy service [can now be configured](...) as [headless](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) at service creation time
* {{ k8spxcjira(1225) }}: The Operator (system) users are now created with the `PASSWORD EXPIRE NEVER` policy to avoid breaking the cluster due to the password expiration set by the `default_password_lifetime` system variable

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spxcjira(1179) }} and {{ k8spxcjira(1183) }}: Fix a bug due to which the Operator didn't use TLS encryption for system users
* {{ k8spxcjira(1188) }}: The database Helm chart has improved defaults, including the use of random passwords generated by the Operator, and disabling `delete-pxc-pvc` and `delete-proxysql-pvc` finalizers to avoid possible data loss during migration
* {{ k8spxcjira(1220) }}: Fix a bug due to which DNS resolution problem could force HAProxy to remove all Percona XtraDB Cluster instances, including alive ones
* {{ k8spxcjira(1164) }}: Fix a bug which caused the Operator to recreate Secrets in case of the ProxySQL to  HAProxy switch with active `delete-proxysql-pvc` finalizer
* {{ k8spxcjira(1255) }}: The log rotation was broken for the audit log, causing it to be written to the old file after the rotation
* {{ k8spxcjira(687) }}: Fix a bug which caused the backup restoration not starting in the environment which previously had a cluster with a failed restore
* {{ k8spxcjira(835) }} and {{ k8spxcjira(1029) }}: Fix a bug which prevented using ProxySQL on the replica cluster in cross-site replication
* {{ k8spxcjira(989) }}: Fix a bug which caused on-demand (manual) backup to fail in IPv6-enabled (dual-stack) environments because fo the backup script unable to figure out the proper Pod IPv4 address (thanks to Song Yang for contribution)
* {{ k8spxcjira(1106) }}: Fix a bug which caused point-in-time recovery failure in case of a corrupted binlog file existence in `/var/lib/mysql`
* {{ k8spxcjira(1122) }}: The new `verifyTLS` PerconaXtraDBClusterRestore Custom Resource option allows to disable verification of the storage server TLS certificate, which may be useful e.g. to skip TLS verification for private S3-compatible storage with a self-issued certificate **IMPROVEMENT** 
* {{ k8spxcjira(1135) }}: Fix a bug which made it possible for cluster to incorrectly obtain READY status while  the svc EXTERNAL-IP was still in pending state
* {{ k8spxcjira(1149) }}: Fix `delete-pxc-pvc` finalizer unable to delete TLS Secret used for external communications in case if this Secret had non-customized default name
* {{ k8spxcjira(1161) }}: Fix a bug due to which PMM couldn't continue monitoring of the HAProxy Pods after the [PMM Server API key change](../monitoring#operator-monitoring-client-token)
* {{ k8spxcjira(1163) }}: Fix a bug that made it impossible to delete the cluster in init state in case of enabled finalizers
* {{ k8spxcjira(1193) }}: Operator requests cert-manager to generate server certificates with `IsCA: True` set **REMOVE**
* {{ k8spxcjira(1199) }}: Fix a bug due to which the Operator couldn't restore backups from Azure blob storage if `spec.backupSource.azure.container` was not specified 
* {{ k8spxcjira(1205) }}: Fix a bug which made the Operator to ignore the `verifyTLS` option for backups deletion caused by the `delete-s3-backup` finalizer (thanks to Christ-Jan Prinse for reporting)
* {{ k8spxcjira(1229) }} and {{ k8spxcjira(1197) }}: Fix a bug due to which the Operator was unable to delete backups from Azure blob storage
* {{ k8spxcjira(1236) }}: Fix the pxc container entrypoint script printing passwords into the standard output
* {{ k8spxcjira(1242) }}: Fix a bug due to which the unquoted password value was passed to the pmm-admin commands, making PMM Client unable to add MySQL service
* {{ k8spxcjira(1243) }}: Fix a bug which prevented deleting PMM agent from the PMM Server inventory on Pod termination
* {{ k8spxcjira(1126) }}: Fix a bug that `pxc-db`Helm chart had PVC-based backup storage enabled by default, which could be inconvenient for the users storing backups in cloud

## Supported Platforms

The Operator was developed and tested with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.32 and 5.7.42. Other options may also work but have not been tested.

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
1.13.0:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.21 - 1.24

* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.21 - 1.24

* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) 1.22 - 1.24

* [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) 4.10 - 4.11

* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) 1.28

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on the backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
